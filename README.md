Source: [Accessing JPA Data with REST](https://spring.io/guides/gs/accessing-data-rest/). This exercise combines

- [Spring HATEOAS](https://spring.io/projects/spring-hateoas)
  - > Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State (HATEOAS) is a component of the REST application architecture that distinguishes it from other network application architectures.
    > 
    > With HATEOAS, a client interacts with a network application whose application servers provide information dynamically through hypermedia. A REST client needs little to no prior knowledge about how to interact with an application or server beyond a generic understanding of hypermedia.
